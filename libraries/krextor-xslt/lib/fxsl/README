About the fxsl directory
========================

The FXSL library by Dimitre Novatchev is distributed under a license that you
can find in the COPYING file.  Using this software implies you are bound by
this license.

For you convenience, we bundle FXSL with Krextor.  Every once a while, we
update to the latest version.  This bundled version is not guaranteed to be up
to date.

For more details about FXSL and obtaining the latest version, please see
https://sourceforge.net/projects/fxsl/ and http://fxsl.sourceforge.net/

Any trouble with the runnable capabilities of _this_ installation should be
reported on the Krextor Trac at https://trac.kwarc.info/krextor/, not to the
FXSL developers.
