About the saxon directory
=========================

The Saxon XSLT processor of Michael Kay is distributed under a license that you
can find in the COPYING file.  Using this software implies you are bound by
this license.

For you convenience, we bundle Saxon with Krextor.  Every once a while, we update to the latest version.

For more details about Saxon and obtaining the latest version, please see:

* http://www.saxonica.com (commercial, schema-aware version)
* http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ (open-source version without schema support;
  the one used here)

Any trouble with the runnable capabilities of _this_ installation should be
reported on the Krextor Trac at http://trac.kwarc.info/krextor/, not to the
Saxon developers.
