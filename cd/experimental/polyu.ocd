     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

   <Description>
     This CD contains operators to deal with polynomials and more precisely 
     Univariate Polynomials.
     Note that recursive polynomials are regarded as univariates in their most
     significant variable (as defined by the order in PolynomialRingR:
     the first variable to appear is the most significant),
     with monomials in decreasing order of exponent, and coefficients
     being polynomials in the rest of the variables, and therefore univariates
     are a special case. This is provided as a separate CD to allow for 
     univariate-only operations (e.g. composition) and for systems that only
     understand univariates, e.g. NTL.  These polynomials are also used to 
     express minimal polynomials for algebraic extensions (see setname2).

     The polynomial x^6 + 3*x^5 +2 can be conceptually encoded as
     poly_u_rep(x,
           term(6,1),
           term(5,3),
	   term(0,2))
     It lies in polynomial_ring_u(Z,x)

       <Description>
          A constructor for monomials, that is products of powers and
          elements of the base ring.
          First argument is from N (the exponent of the variable
          implied by an outer poly_u_rep)
          second argument is a coefficient (from the ground field)

       <Description>
         A constructor for the representation of polynomials.
         The first argument is the polynomial variable, the rest are
         monomials (in decreasing order of exponent).

       The polynomial x^6 + 3*x^5 + 2 may be encoded as:
