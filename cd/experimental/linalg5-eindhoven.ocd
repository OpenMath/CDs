<Name> list_to_vector </Name>
<Description>
This symbol denotes a binary function. Its first argument must be a ring R,
its second argument must be list L with entries belonging to the ring R, up to ring1.expression.
When applied to R and L it represents the vector  of the
same length as the list L whose i-th coordinate  is
L[i] (or ring1.expression(L[i])).

<Name> vector_to_list </Name>
<Description>
This symbol denotes a unary function. Its argument must be a vector v.
When applied to v it represents the list whose entries are the
coordinates of v (with the same indexing).

<Name> matrix_to_list </Name>
<Description>
This symbol denotes a unary function. Its argument must be a matrix A.
When applied to A it represents the list L whose i-th entry 
(for i=1,...rowcount(A)) is the lists L[i]
whose j-th entry
(for j=1,...columncount(A))
is the element A[i,j].
