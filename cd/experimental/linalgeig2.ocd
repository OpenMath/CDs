     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

<Description>
    This CD defines symbols for basic linear algebra over a field of
    characteristic zero related to eigenvalues.

    Regardless of the way of forming vectors and matrices, this CD
    deals with eigenvalues, eigenvectors and related concepts.

<CDDefinition>
<Name> eigenvalue </Name>
<Role>application</Role>
<Description>
This symbol represents a binary function. The first
argument should be a square matrix A defined over the field of complex numbers, the second should be an
index i to specify the eigenvalue. When applied to A and i it represents the
i-th eigenvalue of A (counted without multiplicities). The ordering imposed on the
eigenvalues is first on the modulus of the value, and second on the
argument of the value. A definition of eigenvalue is
given in Elementary Linear Algebra, Stanley I. Grossman in Definition 1 
of chapter 6, page 533.

<CMP> eigenvector(A,i) * A = eigenvalue(A,i)*eigenvector(A,i) </CMP>

<Name> eigenvector </Name>
<Role>application</Role>
<Description>
This symbol represents a binary function. Its first argument should be a
square matrix A defined over the
complex numbers, the second should be an
index i to specify which eigenvalue this eigenvector should be paired
with, with the ordering specified in the definition of eigenvalue in this CD.
When applied to A and i, it represents an eigenvector for A with respect to
the i-th eigenvalue.

<CMP> A*eigenvector(A) = eigenvalue(A)*eigenvector(A) </CMP>
