     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

  <Description>
    This CD defines symbols for handling mixed graphs, multigraphs and labeled graphs.
    Authored by Wouter Termont.
    May have to be merged with the graph1 and graph2 CDs.

  <CDDefinition>
    <Name>mixedgraph</Name>
    <Description>
      This symbol represents a mixed graph. It takes three arguments: the vertex set of the graph, the set of undirected edges, and the set of directed edges (a.k.a. arrows or arcs).
   The vertices can be arbitrary OpenMath objects. Each undirected edge should be a set consisting of two vertices; each directed edge should be a list consisting of two vertices.
    </Description>
    
    <Example>
    A simple chain graph.

    <Name>labelledgraph</Name>
    <Description>
      This symbol represents a labelled (mixed) graph. It takes three arguments: the vertex set of the graph, the set of labelled undirected edges, and the set of labelled directed edges (a.k.a. arrows or arcs). Both vertices and labels can be arbitrary OpenMath objects. Each undirected edge should be a set consisting of two vertices; each directed edge should be a list consisting of two vertices.

    <Example>
    The logical graph corresponding to a traditional Aristotelian square.
