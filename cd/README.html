  <h1>About the CD subversion directory</h1>
  <p>
    This directory is split in three big branches:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Official"><tt>Official</tt></a>: contains all CDs in their form released by the latest
        OpenMath standard.
      </li>
    <li><a href="OfficialDraft"><tt>OfficialDraft</tt></a>: contains current work into making the next version
        of the official content-dictionaries for the upcoming OpenMath standard.
      </li>
    <li><a href="experimental"><tt>experimental</tt></a>:
      contains all other content dictionaries submitted to us.
      They should be grouped into project or ownerships which should
      make management easier.
      Each project directory should, if applicable, contain a <tt>cd</tt>
      and <tt>sts</tt> directory and any other applicable file types.<br/>
      Currently it contains a single <a href="experimental/sortme"><tt>sortme</tt></a> 
      directory with CDs expected
      to reclaim paternity.
      </li>
  </ul>
