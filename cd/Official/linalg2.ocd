     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

<Description>
    This CD  treats matrices and vectors in a row oriented fashion
    (using matrixrow's).

<CDDefinition>
<Name> vector </Name>
<Role>application</Role>
<Description>
This symbol represents an n-ary function used to construct (or describe)
vectors.  Vectors in this CD are considered to be row vectors and must 
therefore be transposed to be considered as column vectors.
</Description>
<Example>
An example of vector using n arguments. 
The specific vector constructed in this example is [3,6,9].

<Name> matrixrow </Name>
<Role>application</Role>
<Description> 
This symbol is an n-ary constructor used to represent rows of
matrices. Its arguments should be members of a ring.
</Description>
<Example>
Representation of a row of a matrix of length two containing the integers
